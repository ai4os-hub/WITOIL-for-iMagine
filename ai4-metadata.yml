title: WITOIL-for-iMagine
summary: "Medslik-II Oil fate lagrangian model"
description: |-
  WITOIL for iMagine is an application using the DEEPaaS API for prediction of transport and transformation of actual or hypothetical oil spills in the oceans using Medslik-II model.
  
  The oil spill model code MEDSLIK-II is a freely available community model. It is designed to be used to predict the transport and weathering of an oil spill, using a lagrangian representation of the oil slick.
  
  As an interactive system, WITOIL requires the input of data for atmospheric wind, sea surface temperature, and sea currents. The atmospheric wind data are provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), at 0.125 horizontal and 6-h temporal resolution. The ocean current data are obtained from the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS) with horizontal resolution of with common resolutions of 1/16° (approximately 6 km) or 1/8° (approximately 12 km), depending on the specific region.

  WITOIL for iMagine provides users with the spatial-temporal distributions of oil concentration at the sea surface and coastline, and the components of oil mass balance. WITOIL output consists of graphics and animations available through web browser.
  

  To use this application, users must first register with two data services:
   - Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS)
   - European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)

  Both of which provide essential reanalysis data for the model.
  
  These registrations are required to download the necessary datasets and ensure compatibility with the model's input.
  
  To proceed, the user must follow these steps:

  >> Step 1 - Register within CMEMS:

   To obtain oceanographic data for the simulation, a Copernicus username and password are required.

   If the user does not already have an account, they can register here: https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/register?redirect=%2Fproducts

   Once the account is created, the user should store their username and password for future use.


  >> Step 2 - Register and accept terms within Climate Data Store from ECMWF

   The next step requires the token from each user to access ERA5 reanalysis data from ECMWF.

   To create an account, the user can go to this link: https://accounts.ecmwf.int/auth/realms/ecmwf/protocol/openid-connect/auth?client_id=cds&scope=openid%20email&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fcds.climate.copernicus.eu%2Fapi%2Fauth%2Fcallback%2Fkeycloak&state=LnmYV9xerVidknPojo3UgHrUPSxQzlbc6x8GMlNWQis&code_challenge=KvF-CRFr9d7MJM4TMUq3sQOvBQZYIie4bB6dLJsSbtQ&code_challenge_method=S256
   
   After completing the registration, the user will have access to the Climate Data Store. From there, they can retrieve their token from their user profile at: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/profile
   
   The token will be located under the "Personal Access Token" section.

   The last step, which is somewhat hidden, is to accept the terms of use for the dataset. The user needs to navigate to the ERA5 single layer page: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels?tab=download
   
   The user needs to scroll down to the bottom of the page until the terms of usage appear, and then they should accept them.

   RUNNING WITOIL FOR iMAGINE

   After obtaining the necessary registrations, the user must fill in the fields correctly to run the model. This includes entering their username, password, and token in the appropriate fields, as well as providing the location and characteristics of the oil spill they wish to simulate.

   Once all the information is entered, the user simply needs to click the "Run" button to execute the simulation.

   After running the application, the results will be displayed through graphics and animations, allowing for an analysis of oil dispersion in the environment. The user will see graphical representations of oil concentrations over time, as well as vectors indicating the direction and intensity of currents and winds, as represented below. These results are crucial for understanding the potential impact of an oil spill and assisting in decision-making for damage mitigation.
