summary: "Medslik-II Oil fate lagrangian model"
description: |-
  WITOIL for iMagine is an advanced application utilizing the DEEPaaS API to predict the
  transport and transformation of actual or hypothetical oil spills in the ocean, powered 
  by the **Medslik-II** model.

  The Medslik-II oil spill model is a community-driven, freely available framework designed
  to predict the movement and weathering of oil slicks using a Lagrangian representation.
  It simulates the dispersion of oil spills based on real-world environmental conditions.

  **Key Features**:
  - **Environmental Data Integration**:
    - Atmospheric wind data provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts
      (ECMWF) with 0.125° horizontal resolution and 6-hour temporal intervals.
    - Ocean current data sourced from the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service
      (CMEMS) with horizontal resolutions of 1/16° (~6 km) or 1/8° (~12 km), depending on 
      the region.
  - **Interactive Inputs**:
    - Users specify details such as spill location, spill characteristics, and environmental
      conditions.
  - **Comprehensive Outputs**:
    - Spatial-temporal distributions of oil concentration at the sea surface and coastline.
    - Detailed breakdown of oil mass balance components.
    - Visualizations in the form of graphics and animations accessible via a web browser.

  To use WITOIL for iMagine, users must first register and obtain essential datasets from the 
  following sources:
  1. **Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS)**:
     - Users must create an account to access oceanographic data required for simulations.
       Registration is available [here](https://data.marine.copernicus.eu/register?redirect=%2Fproducts).Once the account is created, 
       the user should store their username and password for future use.

  2. **European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)**:
     - Users must register and obtain a token to access ERA5 reanalysis data. Registration 
       can be completed [here](https://accounts.ecmwf.int/auth/realms/ecmwf/protocol/openid-connect/auth?client_id=cds&scope=openid%20email&response_type=code&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fcds.climate.copernicus.eu%2Fapi%2Fauth%2Fcallback%2Fkeycloak&state=LnmYV9xerVidknPojo3UgHrUPSxQzlbc6x8GMlNWQis&code_challenge=KvF-CRFr9d7MJM4TMUq3sQOvBQZYIie4bB6dLJsSbtQ&code_challenge_method=S256).
     - Users must retrieve their token from their profile [here](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/profile) 
       under the "Personal Access Token" section. The last step, which is somewhat hidden, is to accept 
       the terms of use for the dataset.

     - The user needs to navigate to the [ERA5 single layer page](https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-pressure-levels?tab=download).
       The user needs to scroll down to the bottom of the page until the terms of usage appear, and then they should accept them.

  **RUNNING WITOIL FOR iMAGINE**:
  Once registrations are complete, users must provide their credentials, spill details, and 
  environmental parameters to run the model. After entering the necessary information, users 
  can execute the simulation by clicking "Run". The outputs include visualizations of oil 
  dispersion, temporal oil concentrations, and current/wind direction vectors.

  This process facilitates informed decision-making for mitigating the impact of oil spills.
